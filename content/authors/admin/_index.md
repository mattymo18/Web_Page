I completed my M.S. (2022) and B.S. (2020) in Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I currently work at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. I use R, Python, and MATLAB to build models and graphics designed to assist with strategic communication between data scientists and people outside the field.

I have a passion for Sports Analytics especially in the NFL. I participated in the 2022 NFL Big Data Bowl and developed new metrics to assess player contribution during punts. 

I love the outdoors and spend most of my time outside of programming fly fishing. I previoulsy worked as a fishing guide on the Kenai Peninsula for Trout and Salmon.
