I am a Masters student in the Data Science and Analytics program at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill with a passion for Sports Analytics.

I completed my undergraduate degree majoring in Statistics and Analytics with a minor in Mathematics from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.

I specialize in R to build models and graphics designed to assist with strategic communication between data scientists and people outside the field. Iâ€™ve also utilized Rshiny to create applications for displaying analyses and conveying results.

Sports analytics has become a major part of my research and is the subject of my thesis. I hope to use [nflfastR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nflfastR/readme/README.html) to gain a deeper understanding of professional football and to predict game outcomes, analyze players, and help on field decision makers leverage data driven insights.
